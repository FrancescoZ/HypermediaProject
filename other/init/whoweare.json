    "text": "Our goal is to provide both measures for which external agencies hold us accountable as well as measures that show how we are performing in key components of quality: patient survival, quality of care, patient safety, efficient care and patient centeredness.<br>We are presenting this information as accurately as possible: We are not creating any new measures or changing the scale, format or target to make ourselves look better or worse. And we’ll be clear about what’s good and what isn’t.<br>Why make this information public? Because we believe that our patients have the right to understand the quality of care we provide, what we are doing well and where we need to do better. We may not always look good, but it is our belief that honesty, and an honest effort to improve when and where we need to, makes for better care.",
